<h1> The Making of <em> Submerged </em> </h1>

<p> ​Welcome! This page details the making of <em> Submerged </em>, an interactive story about an underwater cave. If you haven't played it yet, click <a href= "https://cat-meza.github.io/Web-Production-1/final.html" target="_blank"> here </a> to do so! You can play as one of three different protagonists. Each route explores a different aspect of worldbuilding! </p> 

<p> Below, you'll find the artwork included in the game, process videos of how I made that art, the code I used to build the game, and more! </p>

	<h2> HTML Explanation: </h2> <br>
	<p> 
		&bull; To see the HTML of a page, right click and press 'view page source'. That'll give you the entire HTML document. You can also right click and press inspect. The top part shows the HTML, and when you hover over parts of the code, the part of the website that it affects will be highlighted. This can help you figure out which parts of the code affect what aspects. <br> <br>
		&bull; You'll be saving your document as NAME.html (substituting NAME with whatever you want to name it, of course). The ".html" is very important, as it tells your code editor that you're working with HTML as opposed to some other language. <br><br>
		&bull; In your header, (the part marked by &lt;head>), you can change the title, description content, and author content to fit the page you're creating. Underneath these, I linked my css; you will have to change the href link according to what you name your css document. Similarly, at the bottom of the document, I linked the javascript page. You will also have to change the src to match what you named your javascript document. <br><br>
		&bull; Think of divs as boxes; say you're trying to organize something really small, like beads or jewelry. You can group certain things together by putting them in boxes, and then putting those boxes in other boxes. Just like when you're organizing, you have to be careful not to overuse divs, but they can be really helpful tools! <br><br>
		&bull; You can assign attributes to divs by using ids or assigning a class. The main difference between these two is that ids are a specifc to one div element, while class attributes can be assigned to several divs. Both help you apply styling or interactivity to div elements. The ids we assigned to the first four divs correspond to the javascript, and will be explained there. <br><br>
		&bull; The next three divs- the ones that have class attributes- are the code for displaying the clickable characters at the bottom right of the screen; these characters take you to different links. You can change what link you direct the user to by changing the href. The code 'target="_blank"' ensures that this link opens in a new page; if you simply want to redirect someone, remove that part. The "title" lets your user know where you're directing them. <br><br>
		&bull; That's just the code for the link; the line of code following that is your image. The "alt" is what will show up if your image isn't working, or if your user is using a screen reader; make sure to include this and provide an adequate description. It doesn't have to be long, just accurate! The "height" is the image's height in pixels. You can adjust for width as well, by adding width="" and placing the value in between the quotes. The source (src) is the most important part, as that's how the code knows what image to retrieve. If you have your images in the same folder as your HTML file, your source can look like this: src="NAME.png" (or .jpg, depending on what you're using). If your images are in a different folder, as mine were, you'll have to specify that by directing the code. The more files it's under, the longer it'll be. For example, src="FILE/FILE/FILE/FILE/NAME.png"  <br><br>
		&bull; If you want a logo on the corner of your tab, and if you want to be able to change the shape of your cursor, you'll need a favicon. You can generate one using <a href="https://www.favicon-generator.org/" target="_blank"> this website </a>, but remember; always use your own art, art you commissioned, or art with the permission of the artist. Don't steal anyone's art. For a logo, follow the directions on the website; for a cursor change, check out the CSS section.

	<h2> Javascript Explanation: </h2> <br>
	<p> 
		&bull; Save this document as NAME.js
		&bull; "question", "question1", and "question2" are essentially individual paragraphs. It's where you're going to put the text that your player reads as part of the 'main' narrative. You have to write in between the quotes, and you can write as many sentences as you want in each. Keep in mind that these sentences will not have a visual break. When you're writing the narrative, remember that you only have space for three paragraphs. If you want to add more, you'll have to create a new div in your HTML and assign it a new id ("question3" if you're looking for consistency) and also include it in each section, as well as adding it to the function at the bottom. You would add the following:   document.getElementById("question3").innerHTML = db[currentLocation].question3; . If you only want to show one line's worth of text, you have to put a space in between the quotes, otherwise the javascript won't work. <br><br>
		&bull; The answers will show up as buttons that you can click to lead you to different text. All of the answer choices are wrapped in between these symbols [ ], and further, each individual answer is wrapped as so {} adding a comma for any additional choices. The 'response' is what will actually lead you to your choice. You have to imput a number, or the code won't work. If you don't know what number to use yet, put a placeholder like 1000, as I did in the example. The entirety of the text being displayed on-screen (the "question" and the "answers") are wrapped in {}, and just like with the answers, to make more options, you have to put a comma after. When you're done with all of it, place "];" at the end. <br><br>
		&bull; The part that follows is what actually makes the code run. Essentially, you're using a variable (var db from the beginning of the code- your entire narrative is that variable). The browser is being told to print the 'current location', which initially is zero (that's why we start at zero in the first line). It prints all the questions, and then all the answers. Then, it converts our variable into a number before adding one to it. So, for every successful run through the text, it will add one, and then print the next iteration. It's incredibly helpful to mark for yourself what number you're at, as you will have to reference this number in your choices. Your file can get very long depending on how much you're writing, so you won't be able to tell just by looking. We can do that by adding a comment, using two backward slashes as so //COMMENT. You can see I've done so in the example. <br><br>
		&bull; Every part of this has to be present in your javascript document, and filled in, or you will break the code.
